:numbered:

== Abstract

`Issue!` values are used to represent hashtags, keywords, and identifiers (like serial numbers) that donâ€™t contain spaces.

Issues are part of the `all-word!`` typeset.

== Creation

`Issue!` values can be created using literal syntax, or at runtime by using a `to` conversion.

----
>> to-issue "123.42-xxx"
== #123.42-xxx

>> to-issue #"R"
== #R
----


== Literal syntax

A pound sign `#` followed by a sequence of characters. `issue!` values are terminated by a space, tab, newline, or semicolon.

`#555-555-5555`

`#CODE`1.2.3--42-8`

`#ABC-123-xyx`


== Comparisons

All comparators can be applied on issues: `=, ==, <>, >, <, >=, &lt;=, =?`. 


== Testing values

Use `issue?` to check if a value is of the `issue!` datatype.

----
>> issue? #ABC-123-xyx
== true

>> my-word: #X11'xyz
== #X11'xyz

>> issue? my-word
== true
----

Use `type?` to return the datatype of a given value.

----
>> type? #ABC-123-xyx
== issue!

>> type? my-word
== issue!
----
