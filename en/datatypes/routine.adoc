= Routine! datatype
:toc:
:numbered:

== Abstract

A `routine!` value represents a function with a given Red spec and Red/System body.

The routine specification takes Red datatypes as arguments and return value, and automatically converts them to appropriate Red/System types when called.

Red/System documentation can be found here: https://static.red-lang.org/red-system-specs.html

`Routine!` is a member of the following typesets: `default!`, `any-function!`

== Creation

Routine! values can be created using the built-in function `routine`.

== Literal syntax

```
<routine> ::= routine <routine-spec> <routine-body>
<routine-spec> ::= [<docstring>° <routine-argument>* <locals>° <routine-return>°]
<routine-argument> ::= <word> <argument doc>° | <word> [<type-literal>] <argument-doc>°
<locals> ::= /local <routine-argument>*
<routine-return> ::= return: [<type-literal>]
<type-literal> ::= any-type! | <type-name>
<routine-body> ::= <block>
```

=== Runtime creation

Routine! values are not allowed in the interpreter. They must be preceded by a set-word and then compiled.

```red
Red []

increment: routine [
    n       [integer!]
    return: [integer!]
][
    n + 1
]
```


Argument types for routines are restricted to the single word `any-type!`, or to a type that has a Red/System struct! alias defined here: https://github.com/red/red/blob/master/runtime/datatypes/structures.reds

*Example*

`integer!` is translated to the Red/System equivalent:

```red
red-integer!: alias struct! [
	header 	[integer!]								;-- cell header
	padding	[integer!]								;-- align value on 64-bit boundary
	value	[integer!]								;-- 32-bit signed integer value
	_pad	[integer!]	
]
```

== Testing values

Use `routine?` to check if a value is of the `routine!` datatype.

```red
routine? :increment
```

Use `type?` to return the datatype of a given value.

```red
type? :increment
```
