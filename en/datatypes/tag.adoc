== Abstract

`Tag!` values represent markup language tags and elements.

`Tag!` is a member of the following typsets: `any-string!`, `series!`

== Creation

`Tag!` values can be created using literal syntax, or at runtime using a `make` constructor or a `to` conversion.

```red
>> make tag! "foo"
== <foo>
```

```red
>> to tag! 'bar
== <bar>
```

== Literal syntax

One or more characters enclosed by a open angle bracket `<` and a closing angle bracket `>`.

The first character after the opening angle bracket cannot be `<`, `>`, or `=`.

== Comparisons

All comparators can be applied on `tag!`: `=, ==, <>, >, <, >=, &lt;=, =?`. In addition, `min`, and `max` are also supported.

== Testing values

Use `tag?` to check if a value is of the `tag!` datatype.

```red
>> tag? <foo>
== true
```

Use `type?` to return the datatype of a given value.

```red
>> type? <foo>
== tag!
```

== Pre-defined words
