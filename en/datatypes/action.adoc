== Abstract

`Action!` values are analogous to datatype "methods" in the Red internal OO model. Actions are written in Red/System for a fixed set of operations and are used like normal function values.

`Action!` is a member of the following typesets: `any-function!`, `default!`

== Creation

Action values cannot be created at runtime.

== Conversions

No conversions are supported for `action!` values.

== Comparisons

Action values can be compared for sameness and equality with `same?`, `==`, `equal?`, `strict-equal?`, `not-equal?`, `<>`.

== Testing values

Use `action?` to check if a value is of the `action!` datatype.

```red
>> action? :to
== true
```

Use `type?` to return the datatype of a given value.

```red
>> type? :to
== action!
```

== Predefined words

Predefined `action!` values can be viewed by typing `help action!` in the Red console.
